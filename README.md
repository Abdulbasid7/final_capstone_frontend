Application Overview
--------------------
The application consists of two main parts: the Django backend and the React JS frontend.

Django Backend
----------------
The Django backend is responsible for handling the CRUD operations on student data. It uses Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database. The backend has the following components:

* Models: Define the structure of the student data.
* Views: Handle the HTTP requests and perform the CRUD operations.
* Templates: Define the structure of the HTML pages.

React JS Frontend
------------------
The React JS frontend is responsible for displaying the student data and handling user interactions. It uses React's component-based architecture to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The frontend has the following components:

* Components: Define the structure and behavior of the UI elements.
* Props: Pass data and functions as props to the child components.
* State: Manage the application state and handle user interactions.

Features
--------
The application has the following features:

* Create: Allows users to create new student records.
* Read: Displays a list of student records.
* Update: Allows users to update existing student records.
* Delete: Allows users to delete student records.

Conclusion
------------
This simple student management web application demonstrates the power of Django and React JS in building scalable and maintainable web applications. With its clean and intuitive interface, it is perfect for educational institutions looking to manage their student data efficiently.
